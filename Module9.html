									<h2>Three Basic Principles</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Reduce identified antecedents for problem behavior;</li>
										<li>Reduce identified consequences that maintain problem behavior;</li>
										<li>Reward desired behaviors.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Either of these or a combination of two or more strategies can be used for any given behavior.</p>

									<h3><br>Reduce identified antecedents for problem behavior</h3>
									<p>Reduce situations that trigger behavior.</p>
									<div class="box" id="example1" style="display: none;">

										Not arguing with patients.</p>
									</div>
									<p>Help patients get needs met in appropriate ways.</p>
									<div class="box" id="example2" style="display: none;">
										<p>Example:</br>
										When patients masturbate in public, interrupt them before orgasm. Redirect them to their private rooms.</p>

									<h3><br>Reduce identified consequences that maintain problem behavior</h3>
									<p>Minimize the effectiveness of problem behavior in getting needs met.</p>
									<div class="box" id="example3" style="display: none;">
										<p>Example:</br>
										Ignore mildly annoying behavior, the purpose of which is attention-seeking.</p>
									</div>

									<h3><br>Reward desired behaviors</h3>
									<p>Immediately and frequently.</p>
									<div class="box" id="example4" style="display: none;">
										<p>Example:</br>
										Reward appropriate verbal behavior seconds after the person responds.</p>

									<h2>Specific Behavior Management Strategies</h2>
									<h3>Distraction</h3>
									<p>Distraction is redirecting the person’s attention to a more pleasant activity. (The key to using distraction successfully is knowing the patient. What gets or holds the person’s attention?)</p>

									<h3>Ignoring and Reinforcement</h3>
									<p>When the problem behavior is not dangerous or overly disruptive, ignore it.</p>
									<p>Also, while ignoring mildly disruptive behavior, reinforce more appropriate behavior.</p>

									<h3>Embedding</h3>
									<p>Some tasks may be very unpleasant. Bathing, dressing, and toileting are several of the most common unpleasant activities that seem to trigger problem behavior in persons with dementia.</p>
									<p>The solution to this problem is to make the environment more pleasant by placing preferred objects in the unpleasant environment.</p>

										<p>The following are basic principles in recommending nonpharmacological interventions to staff. The suggestions below are mainly for reducing behavioral excesses.</p>

										<p><i>Intervention Strategies: Basic Principles</i></p>

										<p>There are three basic approaches to managing problem behavior: 1) Reduce identified antecedents for problem behavior; 2) reduce identified consequences that maintain problem behavior; 3) reward desired behaviors. Either of these or a combination of two or more strategies can be used for any given behavior.</p>

										<ol>
											<li><i>Reduce identified antecedents for problem behavior</i></li>
											<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">- <u>Reduce situations that trigger behavior.</u> <i>Example</i>: Not arguing with patients. 
											<br>
											- <u>Help patients get needs met in appropriate ways.</u> <i>Example</i>: When patients masturbate in public, interrupt them before orgasm. Redirect them to their private rooms. Make visual sexual stimuli only available in patients’ rooms. <i>Masturbation in private is a more appropriate way of managing patients’ sexual arousal. As a side note, contrary to popular believe, elderly people often require sex as much as younger individuals.</i>  

											<li><i>Reduce identified consequences that maintain problem behavior</i></li>
											<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">- <u>Minimize the effectiveness of problem behavior in getting needs met.</u> <i>Example</i>: Ignore mildly annoying behavior, the purpose of which is attention-seeking. Provide lots of attention for more appropriate behavior that isn’t as annoying to you.</p>

											<li><i>Reward desired behaviors</i></li>
											<p style="margin-left: 2.5%">- <u>Immediately and frequently.</u> <i>Example</i>: Reward appropriate verbal behavior seconds after the person responds.</p>
										</ol>

										<p><i>Specific Behavior Management Strategies</i></p>

										<p>In addition to the three general strategies above, the three specific strategies below are tried and true techniques designed to make problem behavior unnecessary.</p>

										<p><u>Distraction</u></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Distraction is redirecting the person’s attention to a more pleasant activity.</li>
											<li>This is the most useful strategy in managing problem behavior because persons with dementia are easily redirected. Moreover, because of short-term memory impairment, they can quickly forget why they were angry in the first place (this is especially the case when distracted by a highly preferred activity).</li>
											<li>The key to using distraction successfully is knowing the patient. What gets or holds the person’s attention?</li>
											<li>Distraction can be a verbal or nonverbal strategy. An example of a verbal strategy is changing the conversation. An example of a nonverbal strategy is gently leading the patient to another activity.</li>
											<li>Distraction can be used for a variety of behavior problems.</li>
										</ul>

										<p><u>Ignoring and Reinforcement</u></p>
										<ul>
											<li>When the problem behavior is not dangerous or overly disruptive, ignore it.</li>
											<li>Also, while ignoring mildly disruptive behavior, reinforce more appropriate behavior.</li>
											<li>Find out what is reinforcing for the patient.</li>
											<li>Present reinforcers immediately following the desired behavior(s), consistently and frequently. </li>
										</ul>

										<p><u>Embedding</u></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Some tasks may be very unpleasant. Bathing, dressing, and toileting are several of the most common unpleasant activities that seem to trigger problem behavior in persons with dementia. As a side note, it is important to know whether an individual has a sexual assault history. Challenging behavior is oftentimes defensive behavior. Bathing, dressing an individual, might trigger thoughts, emotions, etc. of past abuse, which might be why he or she lashes out.</li>
											<li>The solution to this problem is to make the environment more pleasant by placing preferred objects in the unpleasant environment (e.g., pleasant odors, music, people). This technique is called <i>embedding</i>.</li>
